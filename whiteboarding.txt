-1hash must include the first card entered as the key
-2hash must include the second card entered as the key
-array gives total

-4hash dealers card (this is where I spit out the answer on whether to hit etc.)
  - makes sure to put in a .downcase for Jack Queen and King and count it = 10


the value is another hash with hit, stand, split, double_hit, or double_stand


can you add values in the hash?
